Create a program that reads the data from a text file with filled up quiz/questionnaire,
Then compare parsed data with correct answers stored in another file.
The program should display the total number of correct answers in percentage point,
and then indicates which questions were answered incorrectly
Threshold to pass the test equals 50%.
